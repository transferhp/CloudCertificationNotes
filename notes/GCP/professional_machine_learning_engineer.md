# Google Cloud Certified - Professional Machine Learning Engineer

# Machine Learning Concept

- A way to derive **repeated predicted insights from data**
- Stages insist of: Training and Inference (Prediction)
- Considered to provide *scalable*, *automatic* and *personalized* solutions

# Framing a business problem as a machine learning problem

1. cast it as a machine learning problem

- [x] what is being predicted?
- [x] what data is needed?

2. cast it as a software problem

- [x] what is the API for the problem during prediction?
- [x] who will use the prediction service?
- [x] How are they doing it today?

3. cast it in the framework of a data problem

- [x] what are some key actions to collect, analyze, predict and react to the data or predictions?
